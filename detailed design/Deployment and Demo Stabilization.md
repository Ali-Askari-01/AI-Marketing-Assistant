🚀 ITERATION 7 — DEPLOYMENT & DEMO STABILIZATION

This iteration ensures your app is competition-ready, fully deployed, stable, and your demo will run smoothly under pressure.

🧱 7.1 ENVIRONMENT SETUP
1️⃣ Environment Variables

Create .env (or use hosting secrets):

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
AI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

Keep .env out of source control

Use secrets management if deploying to Railway/Render

2️⃣ Development vs Production
Feature	Dev	Prod
Database	Local PostgreSQL	Hosted PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase)
AI Key	Test Key	Production Key
Logging	Console	Structured + optional file / cloud logging
CORS	Allow all	Frontend domain only
⚡ 7.2 DEPLOYMENT PLAN
Recommended (Hackathon-Friendly)

Backend: FastAPI app → Docker image → Railway / Render deployment

Database: PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase)

Frontend: React / Next → Vercel / Netlify / Render

AI Provider: OpenAI API key stored as secret

Optional Production Enhancements

Docker Compose: backend + DB

Redis (optional, future async jobs)

Logging / monitoring: Sentry, Logflare

Rate limiting via API Gateway

🏃 7.3 DEMO STABILIZATION
1️⃣ Pre-generated Content

Generate a few campaigns, posts, and replies before demo

Store in DB → avoids AI delays

2️⃣ Backup Screenshots / Recordings

For judge walkthroughs in case AI fails

Include examples of strategy calendar, content posts, video scripts

3️⃣ Frontend Fallbacks

Loading spinner for AI generation

Error banners for failed AI calls

Retry button for AI content generation

📊 7.4 OBSERVABILITY

Even for a hackathon, minimal observability is critical:

Log AI calls: tokens used, model, success/failure

Log errors with timestamps, user_id, endpoint

Optional: console logs for DB writes and AI outputs

🛡 7.5 FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE COMPETITION

Frontend ✅ ready with loading & error handling

Backend ✅ FastAPI routes locked, AI layer isolated

Database ✅ tables, relationships, indexes finalized

AI Layer ✅ prompts, validation, retries, image/video generation ready

Security ✅ JWT auth, ownership validation, standardized errors

Performance ✅ timeouts, async routes, retries

Demo ✅ pre-generated campaigns, fallback content, backup screenshots

🏁 DELIVERABLES OF ITERATION 7
