🧱 ITERATION 1 — COMPLETE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

We design 6 layers:

1️⃣ Client Layer
2️⃣ API Layer
3️⃣ Domain / Service Layer
4️⃣ AI Orchestration Layer
5️⃣ Data Layer
6️⃣ Infrastructure Layer

1️⃣ CLIENT LAYER (Frontend)
Responsibilities

Authentication handling (JWT storage)

Request orchestration

Loading & retry UI states

Optimistic updates (optional)

Polling for async AI jobs

Graceful error rendering

Required Behaviors

✔ Must handle:

401 → redirect to login

429 → show rate limit message

500 → fallback error UI

AI generation in progress

AI failure state

State Requirements

You must define:

Global auth state

Active business context

Campaign state

Content generation state

Analytics state

Critical Question

Will your frontend:

Poll for job status?
OR

Wait synchronously for AI response?

We decide this in backend architecture.

2️⃣ API LAYER (Backend Routing Layer)

This is NOT where logic lives.

It handles:

Input validation (Pydantic / Zod equivalent)

Auth verification

Request forwarding to services

Standardized response formatting

Example Flow
@router.post("/campaign")
def create_campaign(payload: CampaignCreate):
    return campaign_service.create(payload)

The router does NOT:

Call AI directly

Modify DB directly

Handle business logic

Required Middleware

Request logging

JWT verification

Error normalization

Rate limiting (for AI routes)

3️⃣ DOMAIN / SERVICE LAYER

This is your brain.

Contains:

BusinessService

CampaignService

ContentService

AnalyticsService

MessagingService

Example: CampaignService

Responsibilities:

Validate business ownership

Call AI strategy generator

Validate AI output

Store campaign

Create content placeholders

Rules

No raw DB queries in routes

No AI calls in routes

All business rules centralized

4️⃣ AI ORCHESTRATION LAYER (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is where most AI apps fail.

You must create:

ai/
    prompt_builder.py
    schema_validator.py
    ai_client.py
    retry_handler.py
    cost_tracker.py
AI Flow

Step 1: Prompt Builder

Inject business data

Inject tone

Inject constraints

Force JSON schema

Step 2: AI Client

Send request

Timeout control

Token tracking

Step 3: Schema Validator

Validate structure

Repair JSON if needed

Reject invalid format

Step 4: Retry Handler

Retry if:

JSON invalid

Timeout

Empty output

Step 5: Cost Tracker

Store:

tokens used

model used

cost estimation

CRITICAL DESIGN RULE

Routes must NEVER directly call OpenAI.

Only AI Service can.

5️⃣ DATA LAYER

We define clear separation:

ORM models

Repositories

Migrations

Database Structure (High Level)

Entities:

User
Business
Campaign
Content
Analytics
Message
AILog

Relationships

User → many Businesses
Business → many Campaigns
Campaign → many Contents
Business → many Messages
Content → one Analytics record

Index Strategy

Index:

user_id

business_id

campaign_id

created_at

AI apps generate large data — indexing matters.

6️⃣ INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER

Includes:

PostgreSQL

Redis (optional but recommended)

Background Worker

Environment config

Secrets

Logging

Deployment container

🔄 SYNCHRONOUS VS ASYNCHRONOUS AI

You must choose.

OPTION A — Synchronous

Flow:

User clicks generate → API waits → AI responds → return.

Pros:

Simple

Fast to build

Cons:

If AI takes 15 sec → bad UX

Risk of timeout

Hard to scale

OPTION B — Background Job (Recommended)

Flow:

User clicks generate

API creates job record

Returns job_id

Worker processes AI

Frontend polls /job/{id}

When complete → data returned

Pros:

Scalable

Stable

Professional architecture

Cons:

More work

For competition:

If short timeline → synchronous

If serious SaaS → async

⚠ FAILURE DESIGN (Must Plan Now)

Define behavior for:

AI timeout

AI malformed JSON

DB write failure

Duplicate request

User refresh mid-generation

You must document fallback for each.

🔐 SECURITY DESIGN

Must include:

JWT verification

Business ownership validation

Rate limiting on AI endpoints

Input sanitization

Prompt injection guard

📊 OBSERVABILITY DESIGN

Log:

Every AI call

Token usage

Errors

Latency

You need:

Structured logs

Error codes

Monitoring hooks

📦 FINAL ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

You should now have:

✔ Layered separation
✔ AI abstraction layer
✔ Clear data relationships
✔ Sync/Async decision
✔ Error strategy
✔ Security guardrails
🤖 AI Provider → OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini or equivalent)

Why:

Best structured JSON output

Reliable

Supports JSON mode

Good latency

Use:

Lower-cost model for content

Higher-quality for strategy

⚡ AI Execution Model → SYNCHRONOUS (For Competition)

Here’s why:

You’re in final implementation phase.
Background jobs add:

Redis

Worker setup

Job polling

More bugs

More demo risk

For competition:

Keep AI synchronous

Add frontend loading spinner

Add 20–30s timeout guard

If this were production SaaS → async.
For now → synchronous = safer demo.

🧠 Caching → SKIP for now

Redis is optional.
Don’t complicate unless needed.

🚀 Deployment → Railway or Render

Why:

Fast deploy

Easy PostgreSQL

Simple environment variables

Docker optional

Avoid AWS for competition.

🧠 Architectural Principles You MUST Follow

Routes are thin.

AI calls are isolated in one module.

All AI output validated before saving.

Every response follows same error format.

Business ownership always verified.

No raw SQL in routes.

🔥 What You Should NOT Add Right Now

❌ Background workers
❌ Microservices
❌ Kubernetes
❌ Over-engineered caching
❌ Multi-model switching
❌ Real-time websockets

Keep it stable.
